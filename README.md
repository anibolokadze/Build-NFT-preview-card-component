## The challenge
The challenge is to make the view icon appear on hover and set the colour to the image container.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

The designs were created to the following widths:

Mobile: 375px
Desktop: 1440px
